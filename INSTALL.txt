This transport requires jzmq: the ZeroMQ Java language binding. Once you have it compiled for your platform and
installed, the transport must to be included in Mule's classpath.

In addition, the Java VM's native library path must point jzmq's lib folder. This is done by setting the
"java.library.path" property (e.g., -Djava.library.path=/opt/jzmq/lib).

To package the transport, install Maven and from the project's root folder enter the following command:
"mvn package -Djzmq.path=[jzmq path]"
